Message AID-INI,
"Description Aiding position, time, frequency, clock drift",
Firmware Supported on:,
"â€¢",u-blox 8 / u-blox M8 from protocol version 15 up to version 23.01
Type Input/Output,
Comment All UBX-AID messages are deprecated; use UBX-MGA messages instead,
"This message contains position, time and clock drift information. The position can be input",
in either the ECEF X/Y/Z coordinate system or as lat/lon/height. The time can either be input,
"as inexact value via the standard communication interface, suffering from latency",
"depending on the baud rate, or using hardware time synchronization where an accurate",
time pulse is input on the external interrupts. It is also possible to supply hardware,
frequency aiding by connecting a continuous signal to an external interrupt.,
